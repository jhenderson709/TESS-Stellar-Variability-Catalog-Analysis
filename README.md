  Project Background (ARDASTELLA intro, and what im doing – insights to expidite variable star study)
  Executive Summary (Detail data set, show data model, and ARDASTELLA dataset contributions. Seeking hueristics that govern variable star searches, saving resources i.e. money, telescope observation time, etc.)
  Insights Deep-Dive (no text here – straigh to the insights. Focus on metrics and tie things together.)
    insight 1. What stars are most likely to be variable?
    insight 2  What Periods should we expect when looking at stars? For different classes?
    insight 3  Confidence levels reveal trends in pulsation data?
  Recommendations (Guide the research team based on the insights above)
